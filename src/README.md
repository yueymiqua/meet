# Your Meet App

## Project Description
Your Meet App both a web and mobile application(can be downloaded onto Desktop or mobile) that allows the user to receive a list of upcoming CareerFoundry events. Users are able to type in the city that want to view upcoming events in, and are able to view a list of suggested cities based on their input. Upon selecting a city (or choose the "all cities" selection), the user will then be able to view a list of upcoming events pertaining to that city. They can also enter a number between 1 and 32 to specify how many events they would like displayed on the page at once. In the list of events shown, they can view basic information regarding the event (ie. event name, start-time, and location) or click on a button to display more even details (ie. event description and a link to the google calendar invite). By default the details are collapsed. Once the details are displayed, they also have to option to click a button and hide the details. There will also be a scatterchart and a pie chart displayed to show visual representation of the number of events, the type of events, and the location of the events that are upcoming. 
The events are fetched from a Google API inputted by CareerFoundry. Your Meet App also functions offline thanks to it being a Progressive Web Application (secure requests, uses ServiceWorker, and manifest.js).
